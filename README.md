Gradle, Groovy to KTS

## _Groovy syntax is a way too far to understand, so we shall change Android build src to Kotlin Script ( KTS )_
This is how I apply KTS in my projects according to [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/migrate-to-kts] . I used Kotlin's extension funs as implementation dependencies.
Just adding retrofit, room, dagger hilt, jetpack compose and others needed in usual.
